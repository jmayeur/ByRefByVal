Experimenting with references and values in JavaScript

I started reading this blog [JAVASCRIPT: PASSING BY VALUE OR BY REFERENCE](http://snook.ca/archives/javascript/javascript_pass)
and I wanted to see how some of these things worked in progress.  I started with a simple [jsfiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/VgcZg/3/)
but thought I could add some styling using [prism.js](http://prismjs.com/).

This is just learning through practice.
